<a name="html"><h3><u>Hyper Text Markup Language</u></h3>
<p>
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers 
how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as 
the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you 
use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or 
act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to 
connect to another page, italicize words, and so on.
</p>

<p>
Not all elements follow the pattern of an opening tag, content, 
and a closing tag. Some elements consist of a single tag, which is typically 
used to insert/embed something in the document. Such elements are called void elements.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes you will see attributes written without values. This is entirely acceptable.
 These are called Boolean attributes. Boolean attributes can only have one value, 
which is generally the same as the attribute name. For example, consider the disabled 
attribute, which you can assign to form input elements. (You use this to disable the 
form input elements so the user can't make entries.

<a name="css"><h3><u>Cascading Style Sheet</u></h3>
<p>
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation 
of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). 
CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
</p>

<p>
CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers 
according to W3C specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS 
specification was done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest 
recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will 
never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now CSS without a version number.
</p>

<p>
After CSS 2.1, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the 
progress on different CSS modules started to differ so much, that it became more 
effective to develop and release recommendations separately per module. Instead of 
versioning the CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest 
stable state of the CSS specification and individual modules progress. CSS modules 
now have version numbers, or levels, such as CSS Color Module Level 5
</p>

<p>
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for example, 
to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple 
columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This module provides a 
gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, 
what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.
</p>

<p>
This module carries on where CSS first steps left off — now you've gained familiarity 
with the language and its syntax, and got some basic experience with using it, it's 
time to dive a bit deeper. This module looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the 
selector types we have available, units, sizing, styling backgrounds and borders, debugging, 
and lots more.
</p>

<p>
The aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing competent CSS and help 
you understand all the essential theory, before moving on to more specific disciplines 
like text styling and CSS layout.

<a name="js"><h3><u>Javascript</u></h3>
<p>
JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming 
language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting 
language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, 
Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, 
single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and 
declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.
</p>

<p>
JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable 
parameter lists, function variables, dynamic script creation (via eval), object 
introspection (via for...in and Object utilities), and source-code recovery 
(JavaScript functions store their source text and can be retrieved through toString()).
</p>

<p>
This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts
 that are specific to Web pages or other host environments. For information about 
APIs that are specific to Web pages, please see Web APIs and DOM.
</p>

<p>
The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262) 
and the ECMAScript Internationalization API specification (ECMA-402). As soon as 
one browser implements a feature, we try to document it. This means that cases where 
some proposals for new ECMAScript features have already been implemented in browsers, 
documentation and examples in MDN articles may use some of those new features. Most 
of the time, this happens between the stages 3 and 4, and is usually before the spec 
is officially published.
</p>

<p>
Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language — JavaScript is not 
"Interpreted Java". Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks 
of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages have 
very different syntax, semantics, and use.
</p>

<p>
Answers some fundamental questions such as "what is JavaScript?", "what does it look like?", 
and "what can it do?", along with discussing key JavaScript features such as variables, 
strings, numbers, and arrays.

<a name="mysql"><h3><u>MySQL</u></h3>
<p>
Databases are the essential data repository for all software applications. For 
example, whenever someone conducts a web search, logs in to an account, or completes 
a transaction, a database system is storing the information so it can be accessed in the future.
</p>

<p>
A relational database stores data in separate tables rather than putting all the 
data in one big storeroom. The database structure is organized into physical files 
optimized for speed. The logical data model, with objects such as data tables, views, 
rows, and columns, offers a flexible programming environment. You set up rules governing 
the relationships between different data fields, such as one to one, one to many, unique, 
required, or optional, and “pointers” between different tables. The database enforces these 
rules so that with a well-designed database your application never sees data that’s inconsistent, 
duplicated, orphaned, out of date, or missing.
</p>

<p>
The “SQL” part of “MySQL” stands for “Structured Query Language.” SQL is the most 
common standardized language used to access databases. Depending on your programming 
environment, you might enter SQL directly (for example, to generate reports), embed 
SQL statements into code written in another language, or use a language-specific API 
that hides the SQL syntax.
</p>

<p>
Open source means it’s possible for anyone to use and modify the software. 
Anybody can download MySQL software from the internet and use it without paying for it. 
You can also change its source code to suit your needs. MySQL software uses the GNU 
General Public License (GPL) to define what you may and may not do with the software in 
different situations.
<br>
If you feel uncomfortable with the GNU GPL or need to embed MySQL code into a commercial 
application, you can buy a commercially licensed version from Oracle. See the MySQL 
Licensing Information section for more information.
